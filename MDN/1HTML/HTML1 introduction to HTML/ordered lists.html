	<h1>Quick humous recipe</h1> 
	<p>This recipe makes quick, tasty humous, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p> 
	<p>Humous is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
		<li>175g of tahini</li>
		<li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
		<li>Half a red pepper</li>
		<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
		<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
		<li>A dash of olive oil</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    	<li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    	<li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    	<li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    	<li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
    <ul>
    	<li>If you want a coarse "chunky" humous, process it for a short time</li>
         <li> If you want a smooth humous, process it for a longer time</li>
    </ul>
        <li>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</li>   
	</ol>
	<h2>Storage</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Refrigerate the finished humous in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</li>
		<li>Humous is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</li>
	</ul>
